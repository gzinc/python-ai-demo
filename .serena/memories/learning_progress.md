## Overall Progress

**Total Completion**: ___% (0/15 modules completed)

**Milestones Achieved**:
- [x] Understanding Embeddings (Critical conceptual breakthrough!)
- [ ] Phase 1 completed
- [ ] Phase 2 completed
- [ ] Phase 3 completed
- [ ] Phase 4 completed
- [ ] Phase 5 completed

**Projects Built**:
- (none yet - starting Phase 1)

**Skills Acquired**:
- Understanding of embeddings and their role in AI
- Mental model of RAG architecture
- Knowledge of vector databases (ChromaDB, Pinecone, etc.)
- Connection between NumPy and AI applications
- Cost models for embeddings (API vs open-source)

---

## Notes

**Strengths**:
- Strong conceptual understanding of embeddings
- Clear mental model of how AI apps work (RAG pattern)
- Good grasp of cost/tool trade-offs

**Areas for Improvement**:
- Need hands-on practice with NumPy
- Need to complete Phase 1 modules
- Need to actually build something

**Interesting Discoveries**:
- Embeddings are just numbers that encode meaning!
- Can build real AI apps with free tools (sentence-transformers + ChromaDB)
- NumPy is critical because embeddings ARE NumPy arrays
- Vector databases exist specifically for high-dimensional vectors

**Questions to Explore**:
- How exactly are embeddings generated internally?
- What makes one embedding model better than another?
- How to choose chunk size for RAG systems?
